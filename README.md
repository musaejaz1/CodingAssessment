# Game of Life

This coding challenge hsa been performed using PHP 7.0

The basic purpose of this application is to mimick the behaviour of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.

The application is divided into multiple function to make it simplified for anyone looking into.

The universe size can be changed using the const UNIVERSE_SIZE, for now it is set to be 25x25

Methods
1- createUniverse()
  This method is responsible for creating the base universe on the basis of give UNIVERSE_SIZE.

2- makeTheNextUniverse()
  This method creates the next generation of Universe using simple rules as follows.
    a) If the current state is 0/Dead and the cell has 3 live neighbors update the state to 1/Live.
    b) If the current state is 1/Live and the cell has less than 2 live neighbors or more than 3 live neighbors update the state to 2/Dead.
    c) In any other case leave it as it is.
  This method also has the ability to wrap the walls of universe using a flag that is passed in the parameter with a default value of false.
    
3- countNeighbors()
  This method is responsible for computing the sum of neighboring cells.

4- placeOscillator()
  This method is just for fun, because I wanted to see how an oscillator object would look like.

5- placeGliderObject()
  This method is responsible for adding glider object in the center of universe

6- printUniverse()
  This method is responsible for giving us a grid like output of the universe passed in parameter.
